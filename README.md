# Pong.js - Pong for Newbie Coders

## Introduction

This github project is intended as an educational tool for teaching beginners the fundamentals of programming.

Pong.js is a very simple game as a basis for programming exercises in the hope that using a simple visual game makes it easier to relate and reason about what is happening and how to solve common programming problems.

## Prerequisites

To do these exercises you will need:

* A recent version of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* A good source code editor, such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* A minimal local webserver¹ (See [these instructions](doc/webserver-installation.md) to install one inside Chrome itself.)

¹ This example uses modern Javascript module syntax which, unfortunately, does not allow you to use `file://` any more.
